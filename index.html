            <h2>1. Understanding Self-Care</h2>
            <h3>What Does Self-Care Really Mean?</h3>
            <p>Self-care is about taking intentional steps to nurture your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. While activities like exercise, healthy eating, and relaxation are often associated with self-care, mental health care is just as important—if not more so. It’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity for living a balanced and fulfilling life.</p>
